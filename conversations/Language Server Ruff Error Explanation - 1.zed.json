This error usually indicates that a request to the language server was canceled before it could complete, which can happen for various reasons:\n\nCommon causes:\n1. The language server (Ruff in this case) was interrupted during processing\n2. A timeout occurred\n3. Another request superseded the current one\n4. There might be configuration issues with your editor/IDE\n\nTo resolve this:\n\n1. Try restarting your code editor/IDE\n2. Check if Ruff is properly installed and configured\n3. Make sure your Ruff configuration file (if any) is valid\n4. Update Ruff to the latest version\n5. Check if there are any conflicting extensions or language servers\n\nWithout more context about your development environment and setup, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause. Could you share:\n1. Which IDE/editor you're using?\n2. Your Ruff configuration (if any)?\n3. When exactly this error occurs?\nI'm using zed.\n\nThere's no extra configuration specific to ruff, but here's my setings file:\n```json settings.json/\n// Zed settings\n//\n// For information on how to configure Zed, see the Zed\n// documentation: https://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed\n//\n// To see all of Zed's default settings without changing your\n// custom settings, run `zed: open default settings` from the\n// command palette (cmd-shift-p / ctrl-shift-p)\n{\n  \"assistant\": {\n    \"default_model\": {\n      \"provider\": \"zed.dev\",\n      \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\"\n    },\n    \"version\": \"2\"\n  },\n  \"ui_font_size\": 16,\n  \"buffer_font_family\": \"Hack Nerd Font Mono\",\n  \"buffer_font_size\": 12,\n  \"theme\": \"Dracula\",\n  \"vim_mode\": true,\n  // Disable cursor blink\n  \"cursor_blink\": false,\n  // Use relative line numbers\n  \"relative_line_numbers\": true,\n  // Hide the scroll bar\n  \"scrollbar\": { \"show\": \"never\" },\n  // Prevent the buffer from scrolling beyond the last line\n  \"scroll_beyond_last_line\": \"off\",\n  // Allow the cursor to reach the edges of the screen\n  \"vertical_scroll_margin\": 0,\n  // Indentation, rainbow indentation\n  \"indent_guides\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"coloring\": \"indent_aware\"\n  },\n  \"languages\": {\n    // Refer https://zed.dev/docs/languages/javascript and https://zed.dev/docs/languages/typescript for more info\n    \"TypeScript\": {\n      // Refer https://github.com/jellydn/ts-inlay-hints for how to setup for Neovim and VSCode\n      \"inlay_hints\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"show_parameter_hints\": false,\n        \"show_other_hints\": true,\n        \"show_type_hints\": true\n      }\n    },\n    \"Python\": {\n      \"format_on_save\": { \"language_server\": { \"name\": \"ruff\" } },\n      \"formatter\": { \"language_server\": { \"name\": \"ruff\" } },\n      \"language_servers\": [\"pyright\", \"ruff\"]\n    }\n  },\n  // Inlay hints preconfigured by Zed: Go, Rust, Typescript and Svelte\n  \"inlay_hints\": {\n    \"enabled\": true\n  },\n  // File syntax highlighting\n  \"file_types\": {\n    \"Dockerfile\": [\"Dockerfile\", \"Dockerfile.*\"],\n    \"JSON\": [\"json\", \"jsonc\", \"*.code-snippets\"]\n  },\n  // Turn off telemetry\n  \"telemetry\": {\n    \"diagnostics\": false,\n    \"metrics\": false\n  },\n  // File scan exclusions, hide on the file explorer and search\n  \"file_scan_exclusions\": [\n    \"**/.git\",\n    \"**/.svn\",\n    \"**/.hg\",\n    \"**/CVS\",\n    \"**/.DS_Store\",\n    \"**/Thumbs.db\",\n    \"**/.classpath\",\n    \"**/.settings\",\n    // above is default from Zed\n    \"**/out\",\n    \"**/dist\",\n    \"**/.husky\",\n    \"**/.turbo\",\n    \"**/.vscode-test\",\n    \"**/.vscode\",\n    \"**/.next\",\n    \"**/.storybook\",\n    \"**/.tap\",\n    \"**/.nyc_output\",\n    \"**/report\",\n    \"**/node_modules\"\n  ], // Move some unnecessary panels to the left\n  \"notification_panel\": {\n    \"dock\": \"left\"\n  },\n  \"chat_panel\": {\n    \"dock\": \"left\"\n  },\n  \"outline_panel\": {\n    \"dock\": \"right\"\n  },\n  \"collaboration_panel\": {\n    \"dock\": \"left\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nthis error occurs on opening a python file\nI see the issue. This error is likely occurring because of how Ruff is configured in your Zed settings. There are a few things we can try to resolve this:\n\n1. First, try modifying your Python language configuration to separate the formatter and language server settings:\n\n```json\n\"Python\": {\n  \"format_on_save\": true,\n  \"formatter\": \"ruff\",\n  \"language_servers\": [\"pyright\", \"ruff\"]\n}\n```\n\n2. Make sure Ruff is installed in your system/environment:\n```bash\npip install ruff\n```\n\n3. If the issue persists, you could try using Black as the formatter instead of Ruff:\n```json\n\"Python\": {\n  \"format_on_save\": true,\n  \"formatter\": \"black\",\n  \"language_servers\": [\"pyright\", \"ruff\"]\n}\n```\n(You would need to `pip install black` for this)\n\n4. Alternatively, you could try using only Ruff as the language server:\n```json\n\"Python\": {\n  \"format_on_save\": true,\n  \"formatter\": \"ruff\",\n  \"language_servers\": [\"ruff\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe error suggests that the language server request is being canceled, which could be due to:\n- Ruff not being properly installed\n- A conflict between multiple language servers\n- A configuration issue in how Ruff is being used both as a formatter and language server\n\nTry these solutions one at a time and see which one resolves the issue. Also, make sure to restart Zed after making any changes to the settings.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":309}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":86},"start":111,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":310}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":87},"start":1127,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":311}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":108},"start":1142,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":312}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":109},"start":1143,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":313}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":244},"start":4007,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":314}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":293},"start":4050,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":315}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":294},"start":5375,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":316}}}],"summary":"Language Server Ruff Error Explanation","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":81},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"Quoted selection","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1220,"end":4005},"icon":"File","label":"settings.json/","metadata":{"path":"settings.json/"}}]}
